        It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. An Object is an
        instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object
        is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and
        code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each other’s data or code,
        it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects.

        <b>For example:</b> “Dog” is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like color, Breed, Bark, Sleep, and
        Eats.
