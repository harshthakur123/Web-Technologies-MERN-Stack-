        A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and
        used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to
        all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object.

        For Example:

        <b><i>For example:</i></b> Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all
        of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc.
        So here, Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.
